But they quickly realize that their mother isn’t present for most of the story — and, indeed, his ultimate message was more about how much he truly loved “Aunt Robin.” Pulling the ultimate Ted Mosby, he rushes to Robin’s house, blue French horn in hand, and (ignoring her terrible bob and herd of random dogs) finally asks her out.&nbsp;</p><p>After nine seasons of waiting for Ted to meet his true love, who was believed to be The Mother, this resolution enraged and confused many. See just a few of the reactions on Twitter:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><strong>@RahulRachuri1: </strong>Disappointed with the ending.
