It’s hard to believe the 41-year-old is the mother of three children, as Kris Jenner’s eldest child is defying aging. Lounging around poolside in her Calabassas home, Kourtney wore a black bikini and showed off her toned figure and flawless abs. She rested her head against the crook of her arm and posed on her side. Kourtney has drawn plenty of attention for her figure along with her willingness to show off her flaws. Though at first glance, Kourtney looks perfect, she is the first to tell her fans that like all women,&nbsp; she too has stretch marks.</p><p>Kourtney went viral when she shared several bathing suit photos where she showed off her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stretch marks</a>. Though you can’t see her marks in her newest bikini photo, she certainly became more relatable to many people once she showed off her imperfections.</p><p>Kourtney chose the following caption for her photo.</p><p>“Evolve as you please.”</p><p>You may see the bikini photo Kourtney Kardashian shared with her 90.5 million Instagram followers below.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B_f2FYmlKzT/</p><p>One thing many of Kourtney’s fans have commented on is that her body looks more toned and defined than she did in her younger years. Though she may have more stretch marks than before, it is important that women redefine what “beauty” means to them and realize that all bodies are beautiful, and they are always changing. Extra pounds, stretch marks, and the signs that a woman has lived doesn’t reduce her value as a person — no matter what the fashion industry may say.</p><p>Kourtney is the mother of three children and has put her body threw a lot. Though she has access to some of the best treatments out there, she isn’t afraid to show off her stretch marks, take a photo without any makeup on, or put her hair in curlers or a turban for the camera.</p><p>One interesting fact about the 41-year-old is that she doesn’t color her hair. Kourtney’s raven locks are her own, natural color.</p><p>You may see a video showing Kourtney Kardashian getting real with her viewers below.</p><p>https://youtu.be/oEGputI-PIU</p><p>What do you think about Kourtney Kardashian’s willingness to show off her stretch marks?</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Do you think she looks amazing at 41-years-old?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebpMKzwM2esGajkaexor%2FHopinZaOdvLi%2FjKidn2WYmr9utc2smKedXZjCs8LErGSipl2jsrh5wZqroaGenHq0wcitZKmgn6m8tHmScmhxaGBk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
