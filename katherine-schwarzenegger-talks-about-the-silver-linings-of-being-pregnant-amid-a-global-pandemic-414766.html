This is the case for many women out there, of course, including Katherine Schwarzenegger Pratt, who revealed how she’s managed to remain positive in lockdown while expecting her first child with husband Chris Pratt.
As you might remember, it was confirmed that the two were going to be parents almost two months into the quarantine orders in California."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

News, Katherine opened up about passing the time in lockdown.</p><p>According to her, she’s been doing what many other expectant mothers do during this time.</p><p>This includes nesting and also getting more comfortable with cooking at home while in the past she would only use her kitchen for occasional baking.</p><p>When asked if husband Chris Pratt is also part of experimenting in the kitchen, Katherine responded that: ‘Yeah, he’s a very good cook like very, very experienced in the kitchen. So I have been learning from him for sure, especially while we’ve been quarantined. I’m more of the baker in our house and he’s the cook so I’m very, very lucky when it comes to being able to enjoy really yummy, good food because he’s very, very good at all of that.’</p><p>‘And to be able to have a fun day where we go and get everything that we need at the grocery store and cook everything on a Monday and have everything kind of planned throughout the week by storing it in the Brilliance collection just makes eating healthy and eating well really easy, simple and effortless. So it’s been really fun and helpful to do that together,’ she went on to say.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>She’s also taken this time to ‘organize,’ something the pregnant woman assumes is part of her nesting process.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeblsGpsdGipZ5lo5i1uK3Rs5ynnZecsrN505qjpKtdlq%2BwwdNmq6GdXai2rcLEq2SloZ6eu6i%2FjKidZpqVnruoec%2BrnKCmkaPBbq3MoptmmV2cubCuwKVkqZmembKutcJma2psZ2uDcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
