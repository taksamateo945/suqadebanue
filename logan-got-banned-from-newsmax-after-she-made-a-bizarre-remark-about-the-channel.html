They will not prevail.”</p><p>Lara also claimed to have met with a member of “the global cabal” who saw notes indicating intentions to destroy the nation by enabling illegal immigrants to enter:</p><p>“The aim was to infiltrate 100 million illegal immigrants, and they were already at 40 million at the time, and these individuals would dilute what they term the pool of patriots.” Were their exact words? And they would not be taught that America is a wonderful country, or instructed to sing the national anthem with pride, or anything else. They will be taught all of the horrible things about the United States that we are taught now and that our children are taught.”</p><h2>Twitter responds to Lara Logan’s latest remarks</h2><p>After NewsMax distanced itself from Lara Logan’s inflammatory statements while appearing on Eric Bolling’s program, Twitteratis highlighted the prominent journalist’s recent demise owing to her contentious words.&nbsp;Lara Logan started her journalism career as a senior producer with Reuters Television in Africa in 1992. In the mid-1990s, she relocated to London and worked as a stringer for CNN and subsequently for GMTV’s morning program. She subsequently won a $1 million full-time deal with CBS and spent the next 16 years establishing herself.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lara-Logan-2.jpg alt="Lara Logan" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Logan’s career began to fall apart after an erroneous interview with Dylan Davies on 60 Minutes about the 2012 US government facility assault in Libya. She began working with Fox on her own program after leaving CBS News, and she also made frequent appearances. However, her statements equating Dr. Fauci to Josef Mengele caused her to leave the network.</p><p>Twitter users were eager to bring out the journalist’s downfall after NewsMax, a station renowned for entertaining individuals with unorthodox ideas, released a forceful statement condemning her. Lara Logan has not replied to NewsMax’s remark or the outrage on Twitter as of this writing.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Lara Logan’s descent from 60 Minutes to QAnon says quite a lot about the modern right<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/bVeCeZdS6n</a></p><p>— Matthew Gertz (@MattGertz) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">October 21, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>If you ever think you can’t change your life, just remember, Lara Logan went from CBS News to “the Jews are drinking blood in Geneva” in 5 years.</p><p>— Jon Lovett (@jonlovett) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">October 20, 2022</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Journalist</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Lara Logan</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGijqJ%2BRo3qou9NmmZqmnpqxbrLRqKRmppWswK6t12aYn6yVp3q0tMRmpJqclWKubq7Is5irqpViv6a5wKuiZpmSpMK1edOhnGabmJa7r7HLaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
