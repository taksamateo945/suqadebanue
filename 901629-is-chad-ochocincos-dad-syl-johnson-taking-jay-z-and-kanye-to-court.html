But this time, it has nothing to do with him, but rather his father, Syl Johnson. Johnson, a musician, is suing rap superstars Jay-Z and Kanye West for sampling a song of his on their new album, Watch the Throne.
According to the report from BlackSportsOnline.com, Johnson is incensed that he was not given credit for having his track, &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Johnson, a&nbsp;musician, is suing rap superstars Jay-Z and Kanye West for sampling a song of his on their new album, Watch the Throne.</p><p>According to the report from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BlackSportsOnline.com</a>, Johnson is incensed that he was not given credit for having his track, "Different Strokes," sampled on the album, so he is taking Jay-Z and Kanye to court in order to receive a fair cut of the profits.&nbsp;</p><p>“Kanye West​ blew it”&nbsp;when it came to giving credit for sampling Johnson’s “Different Strokes” record on the bonus track “Joy” from Watch The Throne…When asked if the track was stolen, Syl responded, “Well he didn’t pay me…he used my style, my sound, my likeness.”</p><p>While this is an obvious oversight on the part of Jay-Z and Kanye, I would be shocked to see this thing ever go to court. They will pay him off and possibly even include him on an upcoming album in some capacity.&nbsp;</p><p>This kind of thing happens all the time in the music industry. I'm not saying it is right, because it isn't, but rarely will it ever end up in court. I think Jay-Z and Kanye owe Johnson his fair share since they did borrow his intellectual property in order to make their album better.&nbsp;</p><p>Having listened to both songs, I can't see a way that Johnson gets as much money as he is hoping. The only part of his work that is sampled is a "Uh!" at the beginning of the song, so it is not like Jay-Z and Kanye are using his music to improve their sound.</p><p>Regardless, Johnson is entitled to something, since it is his voice on the record and he was not given proper credit for it. The lawsuit might be a bit much, but it will take a small miracle for this to ever get to court.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/follow_me-b.png alt="Follow adamwells1985 on Twitter" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJocGlpZmeGbrXSZpqhmZRivKS0zpygp5ufqHqlrcNmqrKkXZ%2B8qbrSqKVmrJGgtq%2BzjKOYsmWqYq6vsIykmKexlWLBsHnCqKyrrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
