Known for speaking her mind, <strong><a href=#>Brandi Glanville</a> </strong>didn't hold back during a Monday, Nov. 11 appearance on<strong> <a href=#>Andy Cohen</a></strong>'s Watch What Happens Live. The 40-year-old Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star dropped a bombshell: accusing Real Housewives of Miami's <strong>Joanna Krupa</strong> of having an affair with Beverly Hills costar <strong>Yolanda Foster</strong>'s ex-husband <strong>Mohamed Hadid</strong>.</p><p>"Joanna had sex with Mohamed [while he was still married to Yolanda]," Glanville said on the show. "It was one of many affairs. It's not the exact situation. But Mohamed and Yolanda are great now."</p><p>During the after show, Cohen revealed that Krupa, 34, <a href=#>tweeted</a> a response to Glanville's claims. "No wonder her husband left her," Krupa wrote, referencing Glanville's ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Eddie Cibrian</strong></a>'s infamous affair with<strong> <a href=#>LeAnn Rimes</a> </strong>in 2009.</p><p>Glanville's X-rated response? "Well, Mohamed did tell me that her p–sy smelled," she said. "It's true! I'm not lying! And <strong>Lisa Vanderpump </strong>was there when he said it. Sorry, bitch. I win!"</p><p>From there, the feud escalated even more on social media. Hadid <a href=#>tweeted</a>, "Andy @andy. That a lie. I never spoken to Brandy @BrandiGlanville in any way about joanna. Brandy is She is such a scum and a foul mouth." He also wrote a note to his ex-wife: "@YolandaHFoster. I love you mother of my children and my best friend. U know I don't have a foul mouth and I would never use words to brandi." (Married from 1994 to 2000, Hadid and Yolanda share kids Gigi, Bella and Anwar.)</p><p>Foster, 49, who has been married to Grammy-winning musician <strong>David Foster</strong> for two years now, <a href=#>wrote</a>, "Only @MohamedAHadid @joannakrupa & God know d truth of this 12 yr old accusation, l choose 2focus on d now &spare my babies this negativity."&nbsp;</p><p>While Hadid, Foster and Krupa appear to be keeping the peace following the accusations, Glanville seems to be especially remorseful for her comments.&nbsp;</p><p>"My morning is ruined," she <a href=#>tweeted</a> the next morning. "Im crying and going back to sleep bye." She later added, "It was not my intention to hurt anyone last night, I spoke my truth when asked a question-fought back when attacked I love @YolandaHFoster."&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><strong><span>Update</span></strong>:</p><p class=p1>In January 2015, Krupa filed a lawsuit against Glanville over her comments to Andy Cohen.
