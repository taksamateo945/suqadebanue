According to The Boston Globe at the time, the couple quietly exchanged vows at City Hall in Lower Manhattan and Mayor Michael Bloomberg served as their witness.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Two years later, Pompeo and the music producer <a href=# rel=noopener>welcomed daughter <strong>Stella Luna</strong>.</a> “It’s a huge lifestyle change, and I take that very seriously,” the ABC star told Allure in 2008 prior to giving birth. “[Chris and I] enjoy our life so much. We go to Europe and sleep in. So when I have the baby, I won’t feel like we’ve missed any fun, reckless times together, like staying up all night drinking champagne and having sex until five in the morning and not having to get up until two in the afternoon.”</p><p>Pompeo seems to be just as serious when it comes to the future of her professional life. “I definitely don’t have a strong desire to act after Grey’s,” she said during a <a href=# rel=noopener>BuzzFeed-hosted panel</a> last month. “I definitely feel myself transitioning,” the actress continued. “I don’t find acting terribly empowering. For the place I am in my life…I don’t necessarily want to work for other people.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaJylpJWjerG7zKmcqGWjmrCzsdOlsGavlaGwsLnEnWSaZaOasLC6w2aaoaGcmXqlrdSgn62domLAqrHNp5hmpZGuenN8kG1pamg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
