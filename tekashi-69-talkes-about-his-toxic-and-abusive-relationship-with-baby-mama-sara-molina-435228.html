They are disqualifying 100k + sales he has already when it should take into effect on October, not September yet heâ€™s being robbed once again. They just donâ€™t want to see Mexicans win.â€™</p><p>What do you think about what Tekashi said?</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>In other news, It seems that&nbsp;Tekashi 69&nbsp;has a new partnership going on, and this time, itâ€™s with none other than&nbsp;Blac Chyna.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGekmriiv8eiZG9xXamurbfErGSamp%2BqwW60yKxkraeonrBurc2dZJqapai2t7GMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnZq%2BZqbVursCbsGalkaKubr%2FAq5hmpZ%2Bhtq%2BtjG1qbmpibXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
