He helped the Lakers finish with a 43-39 record and reach the Western Conference Finals before being eliminated by the Denver Nuggets.</p><p>The 2023-24 season will be Schröder's 10th in the NBA. The <b>29</b>-year-old entered the league in 2013 as a first-round pick by the Atlanta Hawks. He spent the first five years of his career with the team before being traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder, with whom he spent two seasons. After his first run with the Lakers, he split the 2021-22 season between the Boston Celtics and the Houston Rockets.</p><p>Schröder is a reliable point guard who can thrive both as a starter or a rotation player coming off the bench. Signing him gives the Raptors some cover and insurance for the recently-departed Fred VanVleet, who signed with the Rockets on Friday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZ2aAd4WMnZynppmoerSvx6umnZ2iYq6ovsSeqmasn2J%2FbsXEmqlmamaieqS7za2pmpukYsSqwMdmqZqopKS%2FtHnAn6ueql1merqxwKtksKGknXqtrcqeqaw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
