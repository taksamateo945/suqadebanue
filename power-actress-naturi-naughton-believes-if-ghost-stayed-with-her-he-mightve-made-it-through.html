My grandparents were married for 65 years. So the way I feel about like just people staying together, I’m a little old school,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>After explaining her reasoning, Naughton jokingly brought up her on-screen husband. “Ghost should’ve stayed with me! Hey, he might’ve made it through.”</p><p>During the show’s sixth season, Hardwick’s character, Ghost, was a full-time club owner and an undercover drug lord who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was married to Naughton’s character</a>, Tasha. Tasha was aware of her husband’s undercover operation and made sure to hold down their home life with their three kids.&nbsp;</p><p>Not too long into the show, Ghost began an affair with his high-school sweetheart Angela Valdes, portrayed by Lela Loren, who happened to be a lawyer for the government.&nbsp;</p><p>Tasha, Ghost, and Angela embarked on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an intense love triangle</a> journey, which resulted in Ghost choosing Angela in the end. However, their happy ending didn’t last long due to Angela dying during the show’s season-five finale.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ghost and Tasha.

These include “Power Book II: Ghost,” which follows Rainey Jr.’s character, and “Power Book III: Raising Kanan,” which is a prequel that follows 50 Cent’s character when he was a child.&nbsp;</p><p>The fourth spin-off, “Power Book IV: Force,” follows Ghost’s best friend, Tommy Egan, portrayed by Joseph Sikora.&nbsp;</p><p>Later in her interview, Naughton let Charlamagne Tha God and DJ Envy in on a bit of information regarding the new season for the fourth installation.&nbsp;“Let’s just say Tasha’s still alive; she has not been killed off yet,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>Fans can expect season two of “Power Book IV: Force” to premiere sometime in March 2023.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e49rZmpxX6W8uLHRZpicrKKawLR5zZqrrqqZYruiwcahq6imXZeyrbXEr5ysZZmbeqi0zqyrZquklsamsIywoK2gXZ2ys3nHnmSmoZedwbexjKaYnZ1dnsFuwMerpq6fmGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
