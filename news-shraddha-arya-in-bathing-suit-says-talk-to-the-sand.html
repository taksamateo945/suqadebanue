"I love dancing and for me it is an early morning exercise. I love to play loud music in my room and dance all alone. And when I dance alone in my room, I feel like a star performing in front of a huge audience. I am sure it is a scene to watch out for," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>I Fairer</span></a><span>. Dancing is a great workout for many reasons. Not only does it build strength and promote flexibility, but helps you lose weight and even promotes cardiovascular function. A 2016 study published in the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>American Journal of Preventive Medicine </span></a><span>determined that people who engaged in moderate-intensity dancing were 46 percent less likely to develop heart disease or die from it than non-dancers. In comparison, moderate-intensity walkers were just 25 percent less likely to suffer heart health issues.</span></p><p><span>"I believe that regular physical activity is the best way of exercising," she explains to</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>IWMBuzz.</span></a><span> "As due to all the movements and steps, it helps to keep us healthy and at the same time the fun attached to it keeps one happy and cheerful."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/shutterstock_1061134577.jpg><p><span>Shraddha revealed details about her diet to IWMBuzz.

She also loves soup and salad and avoids junk food.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Shraddha is a big fan of snorkling while on vacation. Surprisingly, putting on a snorkel and fins and swimming through the water is a great workout. In addition to being a great aerobic exercise and burning calories, other health </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>benefits</span></a><span> may include improved cardiovascular function, stress reduction, mood enhancement, and muscular toning.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Shraddha also stays fit on vacation by<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#> jet skiing</a>. </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>According to Health Fitness Revolution</span></a><span>, the average 150-pound rider will burn a surprising 238 calories during a half-hour ride.
