Bozzi’s family knew the noise was coming from the bushes in a neighbor’s yard."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Then they hear hissing,” Bozzi told ABC News.</p><p>Bozzi’s family knew the noise was coming from the bushes in a neighbor’s yard.</p><p>“My daughter came and got me. I couldn’t really see it, so I got close up on it, and he backed up a little bit, and I was like ‘he’s kind of big,'” Bozzi said after coming face-to-face with the alligator.</p><p>The father jumped into action immediately.</p><p>“I was gonna put my shoes on. I had flip-flops on; everybody’s making fun of me (for that),” Bozzi said.</p><p>That’s right – Bozzi went toe-to-toe with an angry alligator…in flip-flops.</p><p>And he was armed with the best thing he could find.</p><p>“Let me get the trash can!” he said.</p><p>It was a showdown between a gator, a guy and a garbage can.</p><p>With the trash can, Bozzi was able to back the gator up. He flipped up the can’s lid and waited for the alligator to approach.</p><p>Once the alligator’s head entered the trash can, Bozzi flipped the lid down.</p><p>“I got him,” Bozzi said.</p><p>The North Philly native, still in flip-flops, walked the gator across the street and down the hill.</p><p>He eventually rolled the trash can to the edge of the water, quickly dropped it and ran away. The gator slowly made its way out of the trash can.</p><p>Bozzi returned and pushed the can, which gave the alligator a nudge to get into the water. He then grabbed his trash can back.</p><p>Bozzi said that’s the one moment where he was truly scared.</p><p>“When I got down to the hill, I thought ‘if I’m dropping him off, there might be three more in the bushes,'” Bozzi said with a laugh.</p><p>His neighbors and many of the millions who have seen the now viral video have called Bozzi a hero. But he’s just happy no one was hurt – gator included.</p><p>“I love all animals. I don’t care how vicious they are, how heavy they are, how small they are; we’re connected somehow. We’re on this planet. I think it was my duty to protect everybody and the animal came out alright,” Bozzi said.</p><p>Bozzi has only lived in Florida for a year.</p><p>He said next time, he’ll probably call animal control to handle any grumpy gators in the neighborhood.</p><p>Copyright © 2021 WLS-TV.
