Everyone who has seen her, even other celebrities, has been utterly awestruck by her stunning good looks and refined demeanor.</p><p>She reminds me very much of Aubrey Hepburn when I think about people from our generation. At one point in time, Zendaya, Jeremy Strong, and Larry David were all sitting next to each other. Despite the fact that both Jeremy and Larry’s wives were also present, all that Jeremy and Larry could do was sneak glances at how gorgeous Zendaya was. Zendaya was the center of attention.</p><p>She began the evening in a stunning bespoke black Valentino gown, which was designed exclusively for her by creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli. For the afterparty, she changed into a stunning custom red Valentino cady couture dress, which was also designed especially for her by Piccioli.</p><p>Earlier in the evening, her show Euphoria won six awards for its second season, including one for Zendaya as best actress in a drama series.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The White Lotus brought home 10 Emmys for HBO and HBO Max, and Succession took home the trophy for best drama series. The proprietor of San Vicente, Jeff Klein, reportedly only allows private events that close down the club two or three times a year, including the A-List CAA Oscar Party and the HBO Emmy Party. Klein selects the “winners” himself among the parties who are granted permission to do this.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRqXqprs6sZJqepJq%2FbrHMprCsZZKWwKl52Z6lnZmplnq4rdJmq6GdXamurbeMqJ1mrJiaerW71qdkbmtibYF1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
