The fans have started the #OperationMissYou project in order to promote Louis’ recent single ‘Miss You’ and want to increase its radio play in the United States.</p><p>The single, which was <a href=#>released in December</a>, received praise from both critics and fans, however, fans were disappointed&nbsp;how little it was promoted in the US. Because of this, the loyal fans have taken it upon themselves to promote ‘Miss You’ by launching&nbsp;#OperationMissYou.</p><p>In order to promote the song, fans are contacting radio&nbsp;DJs with the goal of increasing radio play. In addition to this,&nbsp;they have planned promotional activities, including themed days devoted to watching, streaming, requesting, and voting for “Miss You,” which is culminating in a <a href=#>Thunderclap</a> tomorrow, February 9.</p><p>This is definitely not the first time the loyal fans of Louis Tomlinson have taken music promotion into their own hands. In 2015, fans promoted the One Direction song ‘No Control,’ which was co-written by Louis and featured his vocals heavily. Project ‘No Control’ trended worldwide on Twitter, and purchases of the song increased by an&nbsp;incredible 1,674%.</p><p>In addition to the countless hours spent on promoting both One Direction and Louis’ music, fan fundraisers have raised more than $300,000 for charities, which once again proves how they are just as kind-hearted as they are loyal.</p><p><a href=#>LTHQOfficial.com</a> has partnered with fans for #OperationMissYou. The website creates unique content to promote Louis Tomlinson’s career endeavours and increase buzz about his music throughout the general public as he prepares to release his debut solo album in early 2018.</p><h3>Have you supported&nbsp;#OperationMissYou yet?
