By reducing stress, wearing skin-friendly sweaters, and/or applying fragrance-free skin-care products, you can likely bypass flareups and irritation. If&nbsp; you’re struggling with itching and sensitivity all over your body, though, it can be easy to overlook this one thing: bedding.</p><p>“Rough bedding can irritate sensitive skin and particularly those with eczema,” says Leah Ansell, MD, FAAD, a board-certified dermatologist and professor of dermatology at Columbia University Medical Center. “It can cause abrasions to already sensitive skin, which can allow inflammation or infections to occur.” The good news is, the best bedding for eczema can work wonders on compromised skin.</p><h2 id=what-to-look-for-in-the-best-bed-sheets-for-eczema>What to look for in the best bed sheets for eczema</h2><p>Since eczematic skin can be easily irritated, Dr. Ansell says to avoid scratchy fabrics like wool, flannel, and linen. Instead, opt for softer and gentler fabrics like 100 percent cotton, silk, or sateen sheets, particularly ones with a higher thread count. “This usually indicates softer sheets” that can prevent abrasion or rubbing, she adds. How you take care of your bedding matters, too. Per Dr. Ansell, it’s important to give your sheets a regular wash using fragrance-free detergent to soften your sheets and prevent further irritation. Follow these steps, and you’ll be well on your way to itch-free territory.</p><p><span class="inline pr-6 text-seafoam-dark">Related Stories</span></p><p>We asked a dermatologist to share their hot tips and recommendations for choosing eczema-friendly bedding.
