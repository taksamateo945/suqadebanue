After her family relocated to Gainesville, she completed high school at the age of 16 and then began ministry work with the local Juvenile Detention Center. Anna noticed Josh Duggar when she saw him in a documentary, 14 Children & Pregnant, on the Discovery Health Channel. Shortly after meeting, they began a courtship that ultimately led to their marriage in 2008. After appearing on 17 Kids and Counting and 19 Kids and Counting: First Grandson, the news broke about the 2006 investigation that Josh Duggar had sexually assaulted five underage girls when he was a teenager, including his own sisters. Anna released a statement in support of her husband. The following are five things we didn’t know about Anna Duggar:</p><p><strong>Anna Is Pro Life</strong></p><p>It’s no surprise that Anna is undeniably pro life. She often takes to Twitter and Instagram to promote her beliefs which sometimes sparks controversy. For example, she used Black History Month to promote an anti-abortion message: “Human beings should be remembered not dismembered. #BlackHistoryMonth #BlackLivesMatter #AllLivesMatter.”</p><p><strong>Rigid Upbringing</strong></p><p>Anna’s upbringing was actually more conservative than Josh Duggar’s. She and her siblings had 15 minute one-on-one sessions with their mom once a week. It was a time to share their feelings but other than that they had to keep their feelings to themselves.</p><p><strong>It Was Love At First Sight</strong></p><p>She fell in love with Josh Duggar when she watched his family’s first reality show special, 14 Children and Pregnant Again! She says, “As my family watched the video, I noticed how Joshua, then age sixteen, shared the importance of guarding his heart and waiting for someone who would really love him and wasn’t going to just get carried away with their emotions,” “I was so excited to see another family who was brought up so similar to the way our parents were training us, but never would I have dreamed what God had in store!”</p><p><strong>Not Giving Up On Her Marriage</strong></p><p>Reportedly, Anna will not leave Josh, even after all he’s done to her. One insider revealed, “Anna will not leave him. As with her in-laws, she is turning more to her faith than ever. One would assume that they are praying and building their faith but not together. Josh is currently undergoing “treatment” in a long-term facility. Anna has also said that it would be “ungodly” to leave Josh in his time of need.</p><p><strong>Interesting Family Support</strong></p><p>Anna’s siblings have spoken out offering their sister advice on her current situation. After hearing the news, Anna’s brother Daniel responded on social media saying, “I won’t stop trying to get that pig out of our family.” He even offered to get her away from Josh, but she told him she was not interested in leaving her husband. Her younger sister recently contacted her offering to buy plane tickets for her and the children to leave for a while. However, Anna has been told by her parents and in-laws that “divorce is not an option” and to “stay with him.” Her own father told her to say, because even King David had an affair.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGidoq6VYsGptc2gqmaxn6p6pbXDp6tmo56kxG6twaisrWWRo7uiecOunqCZomQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
