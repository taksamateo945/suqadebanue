In time for spring work. &lt;br>&lt;br>Here is a video of him training: &lt;a href="https://t.co/xSi73rtGyE">pic.twitter.com/xSi73rtGyE&lt;/a></p><p>Travis had his stellar senior season cut short when he suffered the injury during Florida State's game against North Alabama on Nov. 18. Before going down, he led the Seminoles to an 11-0 record and threw for 2,734 yards, 20 touchdowns and just two interceptions while also adding seven rushing touchdowns. He earned ACC Player of the Year and Offensive Player of the Year honors and finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting.</p><p>B/R NFL scout <a href=#>Derrik Klassen</a> described Travis as a developmental prospect in his scouting report of the 23-year-old.</p><p>"Travis is a backup quarterback whose athletic profile and moderately intriguing scrambling are the foundation of his game," Klassen stated.</p><p>The Jets are in need of a new quarterback of the future following the disastrous tenure of 2021 No. 2 overall pick Zach Wilson. New York has not been able to find a trade suitor for Wilson so far this offseason, but his time in the Big Apple is expected to come to an end at any moment.</p><p>If the Jets take a chance on Travis, he will have the chance to develop behind four-time NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers, who is set to return from his torn Achilles in the 2024 season. The 40-year-old likely doesn't have much time left in the NFL, so finding the right prospect to learn from him will be crucial to New York's future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWuBd4KMp52lZZSnrqfAjGtna2xdp8Kuu9GsZKOnopmur3nTq5ivoaNiwbB51aKqoqxdn7K1v4yapKKcXaGyqHnIp6Guqqliv6avzq%2Bcq7E%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
