His most notable achievements include writing and developing “RWBY” and “RWBY Chibi”, two popular Rooster Teeth shows. He does a lot of voice acting for his characters, ensuring that you get to see his vision in its integral form.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Family>Early Life and Family</span></h2><p>Miles was born into an American family, which soon relocated to San Antonio, Texas where Miles spent most of his formative years. His mother, Becky Luna, is Irish-American, who worked as a teacher for most of her career, but is now in retirement and devoted to <a rel=nofollow href=#>her Twitter account</a>. As for Miles’s dad, there is not much information on him, other than that he likes to be called Papa Luna due to his Hispanic roots, and that he loves <a rel=nofollow href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>. Miles grew up with a younger brother named <a rel=nofollow href=#>Dylan</a>, born on 25 April 1994. Rooster Teeth fans know Dylan as the inspiration behind Miles’s little brother, whom he pushed down the stars in the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Rooster Teeth Animated Adventures</a> episode, “<a rel=nofollow href=#>A Staircase of Assault</a>”. Dylan is an avid athlete and loves to stream his gaming endeavors on Twitch. Miles even joined him one time, and you can see their adventures in the “<a rel=nofollow href=#>Mediocre Luna bros</a>” video on Dylan’s <a rel=nofollow href=#>channel</a>.</p><h2><span id=Education_Developing_an_Interest_in_Filmmaking_Rooster_Teeth_and_More>Education: Developing an Interest in Filmmaking, Rooster Teeth and More</span></h2><p>While he was still a high school student, Miles developed an interest for filmmaking. On his old YouTube <a rel=nofollow href=#>channel</a>, you can even see some of his project from when he was just a teenager, such as “<a rel=nofollow href=#>El Chupacabra Movie Trailer</a>” and “<a rel=nofollow href=#>Palapas Promos</a>”. These just might be the first pieces of content by Miles. After matriculating from high school, Miles wanted to enroll at the <a rel=nofollow href=#>University of Texas, Austin</a>. He was a candidate to be accepted into the Liberal Arts program, but his chances were slim. Thus, he decided to take matters in his own hands and write a letter to the Dean of the School of Communications. Here’s Miles’s <a rel=nofollow href=#>his recollection</a> of the situation. ‘I actually scheduled a meeting with the Dean in person, which most people don’t do. I was like ‘Yo, my name is Miles, these are my hopes and aspirations, here’s how I hope to achieve that, what can I do to better my chances. The Dean said that taking this initiative put me a step above everyone else.’ Needless to say, he was accepted.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographypedia.org///biographypedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DQjYNw1UQAAchLX-1024x684.jpg></p><h3><span id=Significance_of_His_Time_at_UT_and_Making_Connections>Significance of His Time at UT and Making Connections</span></h3><p>Upon being accepted into UT in 2009, Miles met a lot of his future Rooster Teeth colleagues, including Blaine Gibson, Lindsay Jones and Kyle Taylor. The thing that helped Miles gain a lot of experience in filmmaking, writing and production was Texas Student TV. On the platform, Miles and his friends made a show dedicated to gaming, named “Video Game Hour Live”. Alongside Kyle Taylor, he started running “The Noob Corner”. Miles always knew that he wanted to make cartoons, so he took a variety of classes, including an animation class, a producing class and a writing course. What was the result of Miles’s search for an ideal niche? He found out he wanted to stay as far away from animation as possible. ‘I was actually bummed to find out: I hated animation. It was WONDERFULLY rewarding when you had the finished product, but I do not have the discipline and attention-span to draw that over and over and over again. But I found that I really liked writing.’, he said.</p><h2><span id=Career_Beginnings_A_Rough_Start_Rejections_and_Hope>Career Beginnings: A Rough Start, Rejections and Hope</span></h2><p>When Miles graduated in 2012, he was already a relatively formed writer with a clear idea of what he wanted to do and what kind of cartoons he could make. His first application to work as an intern at Nickelodeon didn’t go so well – he didn’t make it out of the first round of the application process. At Cartoon Network, things went a little better, but he still failed to pass the second round of the test. This failure got to him, but then, something unexpected happened. ‘I was really really heartbroken’, <a rel=nofollow href=#>stated Miles</a>. ‘And then I was offered an internship at Rooster Teeth and I thought ‘You know, this isn’t exactly where I wanted to be but at least I could learn something from being here and maybe get some experience that could help me along the way…’ (Miles and the audience start laughing) I can tell you I have NEVER been so happy to fail at getting internships in my life! Rooster Teeth turned out to be a dream come true.’</p><h2><span id=Getting_Settled_at_Rooster_Teeth>Getting Settled at Rooster Teeth</span></h2><p>Miles had his start with Rooster Teeth as an assistant writer on the popular science fiction “<a rel=nofollow href=#>Red vs. Blue</a>” mini-series during seasons nine and ten, which received new life under Miles’s watchful eye. Not too long after his writing debut, he was promoted by Burnie Burns into a dual writer and director role, which effectively gave him control over the entire “Red vs. Blue” series. Some companies wouldn’t have given the reins to their oldest and most popular franchise to a newbie, but Miles showed right away that he was indeed special.</p><h3><span id=His_Own_Creations_RWBY_and_RWBY_Chibi>His Own Creations: RWBY and RWBY Chibi</span></h3><p>Alongside <a rel=nofollow href=#>Monty Oum</a> and <a rel=nofollow href=#>Kerry Shawcross</a>, Mile created the now-cult classic series, “<a rel=nofollow href=#>RWBY</a>”. The animated installment revolves around the events on Remnant, a fictional world where the forces of good fight against supernatural beings known as Creatures of Grimm. The show’s protagonists are four young aspiring Hunters at the Beacon Academy – Ruby, Weiss, Blake and Yang (the beginning letters of their names form the name of the show). “RWBY” is still being produced, as it has turned out to be a smash hit around the world, especially Japan, where it was dubbed, too. Due to an immense interest in the show’s continuation, Miles and his crew created “<a rel=nofollow href=#>RWBY Chibi</a>”, an animated series where RWBY characters appear in chibi form, making jokes and fooling around. <a rel=nofollow href=#>Chibi</a> is a Japanese form of caricature, where character have small limbs and big heads, resembling children.</p><h3><span id=Other_Work_at_Rooster_Teeth>Other Work at Rooster Teeth</span></h3><p>After 2016, Miles is longer the director and writer of “Red vs. Blue”. He passed the position to colleague Joe Nicolosi, just as Burnie Burns did to him. According to Miles himself, he ‘…reached a point where I felt as though I could no longer take the Reds and Blues to new and interesting places without it feeling forced..’. He elaborates on this matter extensively in the “<a rel=nofollow href=#>Red vs. Blue: Goodbye and Hello</a>” post on the Rooster Teeth official website. From 2015, Miles has been the Head Writer of Animation at the company, with his most recent achievements being “<a rel=nofollow href=#>Camp Camp</a><u>”</u> and “<a rel=nofollow href=#>Nomad of Nowhere</a><u>”</u>. In his position, every script for every show that comes out of Rooster Teeth has to be approved by him.</p><h3><span id=Voice_Acting>Voice Acting</span></h3><p>Miles is also a talented voice actor, who managed to bestow his talents upon many of Rooster Teeth’s hit shows. His most significant roles include Jaune Arc in both “RWBY” and “RWBY Chibi”, Cronut and Felic in “Red vs. Blue” and David in “Camp Camp”. All of these characters received significant praise from both fans and critics alike, further reinforcing the notion that Miles is immensely talented at anything even remotely cartoon-related.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life_Does_Miles_Luna_Have_a_Girlfriend>Personal Life: Does Miles Luna Have a Girlfriend?</span></h2><p>Yes, Miles Luna is <a rel=nofollow href=#>in an apparently happy relationship</a> with Eleanor Main, known as “Ellie”. She is a colleague of his at Rooster Teeth, where she is a director, editor, writer and camera operator all at the same time. They tried really hard to keep their relationship under wraps, but finally revealed it during a Twitch streaming session. As of now, they are not married and don’t plan on having children any time soon. From 2012 to 2015, he was in a relationship with <a rel=nofollow href=#>Arryn Zech</a>, a voice actress who assumed the role of Blake in “RWBY” as well as Emily Grey in “Red vs. Blue”.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Water break. <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/5S3YOuHcgV</a></p><p>— Miles Luna #BlackLivesMatter (@TheMilesLuna) <a rel=nofollow href=#>May 27, 2019</a></p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_How_Tall_is_Miles_Luna>Body Measurements: How Tall is Miles Luna?</span></h2><p>Miles Luna is 6ft 2in (188 cm) tall; hHis weight and vital statistics are unknown. He has brown eyes and almost pitch black hair. Fans know about his love of lumberjack shirts. Recently, he has taken up jogging and working out in the gym, apparently to improve his quality of life.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographypedia.org///biographypedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DVy2dJdU8AA8dDz-819x1024.jpg></p><h2><span id=What_is_Miles_Lunas_Net_Worth>What is Miles Luna’s Net Worth?</span></h2><p>According to authoritative sources, Miles Luna has a net worth of approximately <a rel=nofollow href=#>$1.2 million</a>, as of mid-2019, accumulated by working even when he was attending UT. Holding the position of Head Writer of Animation allowed him to expand his influence and work on a lot of lucrative projects at Rooster Teeth. Given the fact that he is still young, we can easily see his net worth rise to an eight-figure amount in the near future, if he manages his career wisely.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Presence>Social Media Presence</span></h2><p>Like almost every celebrity, Miles has realized the importance of social media as a tool for expanding his influence and interacting with his many fans. He is an avid <a rel=nofollow href=#>Instagram </a>user, with an account that is followed by 100,000 people. <a rel=nofollow href=#>Twitter </a>is another favorite platform of his, on which 50,000 people follow him. Unbeknownst to most, Miles has a <a rel=nofollow href=#>YouTube </a>channel, with 11,000 subscribers and 300,000 unique views. He also runs a <a rel=nofollow href=#>Twitch </a>account, with 14,000 fans.</p><h2 class=tabtitle><span id=General_Info><span id=General_info>General Info</span></span></h2><table readability=2><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Miles Luna</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Voice Actor, Film director, Screenwriter</td></tr></table><h2 class=tabtitle><span id=Accomplishments><span id=Accomplishments>Accomplishments</span></span></h2><table><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>RWBY</td></tr></table><h2 class=tabtitle><span id=Social_profile_links><span id=Social_profile_links>Social profile links</span></span></h2><h2 class=tabtitle><span id=Movies><span id=Movies>Movies</span></span></h2><h3 class=toggle-head><span id=Writer>Writer <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></span></h3><table class=writer readability=13><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=6><td>RWBY</td><td></td><td>TV Series 29 episodes, 2013 - 2016 writer - 20 episodes, 2014 - 2016 written by - 11 episodes, 2016 - 2017</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=8><td>RWBY Chibi</td><td></td><td>TV Series developed by - 31 episodes, 2016 - 2017 written by - 14 episodes, 2016 - 2017 story by - 2 episodes, 2017 story - 2 episodes, 2016 - 2017 head of story - 1 episode, 2017</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Camp Camp</td><td></td><td>TV Series developed by - 19 episodes, 2016 - 2017 creator - 14 episodes, 2016 - 2017 created by - 9 episodes, 2017 written by - 9 episodes, 2016 - 2017 series writer - 1 episode, 2017 writer - 1 episode, 2017</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>RWBY: Volume 4</td><td>2017</td><td>Video story / written by</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>RWBY Volume 3</td><td>2016</td><td>Video writer</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>RWBY: Grimm Eclipse</td><td>2015</td><td>Video Game</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Red vs. Blue: Season 13</td><td>2015</td><td>Video</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>RWBY: Volume 2</td><td>2014</td><td>Video written by</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Red vs Blue: Season 12</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Red vs Blue: Season 11</td><td>2013</td><td>Video</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>RWBY: Volume 1</td><td>2013</td><td>Video written by</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Red vs. Blue: Season 10</td><td>2012</td><td>Video</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Best Red vs. Blue.
