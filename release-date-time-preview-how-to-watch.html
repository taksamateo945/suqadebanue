They almost do, but Yor’s brother changes his mind at the last minute. His belligerent behavior earns him a few slaps from his sister before he departs. And although Loid attempts to keep things cordial — friendly, even — Yuri vows to expose their union as a lie.</p><p>That’s an ominous place to leave things, especially since Loid and Yor are being dishonest. Fortunately, Loid already knows that Yuri is part of the secret police. In “Show Off How in Love You Are,” he embraces his Twilight persona fully, even investigating whether Yor is trying to spy on him as well.</p><p>His efforts turn up nothing unusual, and the Forgers are back to normal by the time the episode ends.
