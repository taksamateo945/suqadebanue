Though many hope Kourtney and Scott are back together, it is unclear whether they are romantically involved or just co-parenting together. The outing marked several over the weekend that the parents spent with their kids Penelope, Mason, and Reign. Joining Kourtney, Scott, and their children on July 19, 2020, in Malibu were Kendall Jenner, Fai Khadra, Addison Rae, Phil Riportella, and Simon Huck. Kourtney showed off her beach body while wearing an Akoia Swim bikini. It’s hard to believe that Kourtney is 41-years-old and the mother of three children with her flawless abs and fabulous figure. Kourtney showed off both with the Kerbau bikini that is crafted in 100 percent organic cotton in Bali. The bikini is available in chocolate and features several shades of brown in a striped pattern.</p><p>Kourtney protected her hair from the sun with a hat from Janessa Leone. The hat is called the Jade Bolero and costs approximately $280.</p><p>Showing off her abs, Kourtney looked chic as she covered her legs by wearing a pair of Issey Miyake pants. The garment is a vintage item and Kourtney wore the pants in brown as that was the perfect addition to her bathing suit top. She wore a pair of sunglasses to shield her eyes from the sun’s bright rays.</p><p>You may see the report Just Jared shared about Kourtney Kardashian’s weekend beach visit with <a href=# title="Kourtney Kardashian Shares Group Photos Of Sisters And Mother Kris Jenner Flipping The Bird On Valentine’s Day — Is This A Message To Scott Disick?" data-um-autolink>Scott Disick</a> and more below.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kourtney Kardashian & Kendall Jenner soak up the sun during a day at the beach with family and friends! <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/lKQ5f5Td8n</a></p><p>— JustJared.com (@JustJared) <a href=# rel=nofollow>July 19, 2020</a></p><p>Kourtney and Scott were also seen together at the beach. As the sightings come after his rumored split from Sofia Richie, plus a sighting of the two, fans are downright confused about their relationship status. Some have even asked if Scott and Kourtney have been in an open relationship. Without either of them going public and sharing the details of their private life, it seems no one knows for certain if they are a couple or not.</p><p>Kourtney dressed casually for the outing and wore an oversized, navy blue sweatshirt with a Fendi, reversible bucket hat.
