However, this is not the case since residents of the town will not say, “I don’t want to learn the guitar!” when they see a sign in the town square that advertises the availability of guitar tuition if someone hangs the poster there. I’d love to learn how to play the piano!</p><p>He continued by saying, Well, then you weren’t the target audience for that sign. It was intended for another individual! So you don’t have to let all this get you in a rage.</p><p>In the wake of the show’s airing, internet users were eager to point out that his remark was strikingly similar to a joke from Ricky Gervais’s 2018 Netflix special, Humanity.</p><p>According to CNN, Ricky Gervais compared it to entering a town square as he spoke in the special. And there’s a signup sheet for guitar instruction, so you head over there. However, I have absolutely no interest in taking guitar lessons.</p><p>When accusations surfaced on Twitter that Corden had stolen a comedy piece from Ricky Gervais, the star of The Office, who is 61 years old, stated that he did not believe Corden willfully took the joke.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>No. ‘I suppose one of the writers came up with it for him,’ Gervais tweeted on Tuesday, adding that he had doubts that the comedian would intentionally duplicate such a well-known stand-up routine word for word like that. After further investigation, Corden admitted that he had paraphrased Gervais’ joke without realizing it.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGealrqmv4ycpquclaN6qbvSrWSonl2Weq2t055kp6GXncFuwMClomarmKTEbrTArGSdnZ6esqV5wKWjnp%2BRqbawutJmq6GZpGK1pnnSraalnV2Wequ7yp5kn6qfonqztcKksGaflafDorXSZmxsbmJngnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
