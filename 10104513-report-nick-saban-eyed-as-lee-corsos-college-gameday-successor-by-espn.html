But going from coaching to the entertainment side of the game would undoubtedly be an adjustment for the man who <a href=# rel=noopener>liked to compare</a> the media hype surrounding his team to "rat poison."</p><p>The knowledge of the game he would bring to the program would be unrivaled, however.</p><p>"I don't know if [Saban] has the passion for the fans that Corso does or the entertainment aspect of things," a source told Front Office Sports. "But it certainly makes a lot of sense."</p>Richard Deitsch <span class=acct>@richarddeitsch</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>This goes back many years. &lt;a href="https://t.co/OW1oyYiEQ5">https://t.co/OW1oyYiEQ5&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/3ghmSmiJfB">pic.twitter.com/3ghmSmiJfB&lt;/a></p><p>Saban, 72, posted an incredible career record of 297-71-1 in his college career, with stops at Toledo (1990), Michigan State (1995-99), LSU (2000-04) and Alabama (2007-23). His accolades include seven national championships, a 19-12 record in bowl games and a 9-5 record in the College Football Playoff.</p><p>He also had a cup of coffee in the NFL, going 15–17 with the Miami Dolphins in the 2005-06 seasons.</p><p>Former coaches and quarterbacks generally transition well into broadcasting analyst roles, and networks pay big money for high-profile options like Saban. Look no further than the 10-year, $375 million contract Tom Brady <a href=# rel=noopener>signed with Fox</a> to eventually become its top color commentator on its NFL broadcasts.</p><p>Fox also went with a former college coach as part of its <i>Big Noon Kickoff </i>program, bringing aboard the controversial former coach of Utah, Florida, Ohio State and the Jacksonville Jaguars, Urban Meyer.</p><p>ESPN landing Saban would undoubtedly up the ante in the college football broadcasting wars.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGmCcn%2BMq5ypp6Kpeq%2B1wqRkrJmSlrtusdiem2aZo2K5prGMnKarq5%2BoeqS7y6WcoJ1dnK6uscOasGarpZiwpr%2FSqKlmmqlisrS8zQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
