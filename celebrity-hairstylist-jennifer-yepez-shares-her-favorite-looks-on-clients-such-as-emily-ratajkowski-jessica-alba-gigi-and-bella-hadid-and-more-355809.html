In a video featuring celebrities such as Emily Ratajkowski, Laura Harrier, Salma Hayek, Kaia and Cindy Gerber, Bella and Gigi Hadid, Sofia Vergara, Adriana Lima, Sabrina Carpenter, Izabel Goulart, and Adria Arjona. Jennifer looks as if she were a celebrity herself and she understands the nature of beauty. She has many celebrity clients and her video featuring her favorite looks is getting plenty of attention.</p><p>Featured on the cover of the video is Emily Rajkowski who wore a revealing outfit at the 2019 MET Gala. Emily’s dress caused a sensation as many people felt she was nearly naked.&nbsp; Emily wore a beautiful headpiece that featured crystal sidepieces that extended to her dress. Her long dark, brown hair was parted in the middle and it topped Jennifer’s list of favorite looks from 2019.</p><p>Several photos of sisters Bella and Gigi Hadid made the list and it wasn’t hard to see why. From long, loose and flowy waves to slicked-back high ponytails, Bella and Gigi modeled a number of different hairstyles. One photo of Bella with her hair pinned up in a knot paired with long, side-swept bangs went viral across social media networks when Bella’s fans saw it.</p><p>Several styles featuring Jessica Alba also made the list. Bows are in high fashion right now, and after Jennifer Aniston wore an oversized Jennifer Behr <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bow</a> for InStyle magazine, more people are turning to the trend. Oversized bows are showing up in hairstyles, dresses, blouses, practically everywhere. It seems there is no bow to big or small for the current trends.</p><p>Jessica Alba is seen in the video slideshow wearing her hair pulled back away from her face and flowing back in soft, romantic waves with a large, black bow atop her head.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B6vrr9CBqLv/</p><p>What do you think of Jennifer Yepez’s picks for her favorite looks for 2019?
